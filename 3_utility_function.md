In short mathematically related function U with preference relation is called utility function. 
Without formulas you can describe the utility function as continuoes as the relation of preference is continuous.
In R^n+ which is the space of goods.

Here is my AI simulation, with fuzzy sets of a cotnunuous utiility function:

ğŸ“Œ Here I can suppose there is no shortage in goods (fenomenon) because it would imply that for a greater vector of goods Vx > Vy there is a strong (â‰») preference for Vx. This is not possible in the chart.

ğŸ“Œ Hessian in the utility function can be >=0, I can add to the model what is the plot in this fuzzy function, if it's Hessian >=0? This can be also called utility function - it is and this is good situation. 
When the Hessian is not >= 0?
