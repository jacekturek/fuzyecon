In short mathematically related function U with preference relation is called utility function. 
Without formulas you can describe the utility function as continuoes as the relation of preference is continuous.
In R^n+ which is the space of goods.

Here is my AI simulation, with fuzzy sets of a cotnunuous utiility function:

ðŸ“Œ Here I can suppose there is no shortage in goods (fenomenon) because it would imply that for a greater vector of goods Vx > Vy there is a strong (â‰») preference for Vx. This is not possible in the chart.

ðŸ“Œ Utility functions by definition which are convex are important in economics. I can model this with sets lib - excluding the subset of statistically non-convex functions - here the data:

> .N.(c(2,2,1))
> 
> [1] -1 -1  0

ðŸ“‰ For cars (if we have a look on a market) let us prove the I Law Gossen about margin utility:

> .I.(c(2,2,4),c(2,2,1)) [^1]
>
> [1] 1 1 1

It doesn't work in this example.

[^1]: Here the funcion .I. means fuzzy implication (similar to the .N. - fuzzy negation).
