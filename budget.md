# Budget field

Assume the consumer has a budget i.e. amount of money she can spend

> ❗ the 'shopping cart' VectorX

> ❗the prices VectorP

The scalar mult. 

> VectorX ⊕ VecorY <= I

> I - budget limit

The set of 'shopping carts' like
> all Vectors for which the <= conditon is true
is not a fuzzy set of cours but the set is important in math. economics and called the
> budget

The set where the VectorX ⊕ VecorY = I, is called the budget field.

The fuzzy sets can be a research tool also for budget in this science.
