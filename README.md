Here is the description how to use some fuzzy set "sets" features:

https://juandes.github.io/FuzzyLogic-R/docs/fuzzy_tutorial

here, under: fuzzy_inferecne are some details (among other information):

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sets/sets.pdf

Covers many topics:

* preference relation

* utility function
* demand function
* derivatives in utility function

* Other topics are not included (market model, production, dynamic models).
* Thank you.
