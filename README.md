# fuzyecon
Mathematical economics is some system of formulas and models for economic science.
I want to use R laguage library for fuzzy sets, and write about

> *AI and fuzzy logic*

The ("sets") library in R is a tool where fuzzy logic is implemented. [^1]

## 

> ℹ️ Fuzzy sets with the mathematical economics will show some insights into R and AI

Computational methods solve economic models and analyze data. 

> Here is the list of topics that can be in this project:

* demand theory
  * preference relations, 
  * budget field,
  * utility function,
  * demand function,
  * derivatives in utility function 

using fuzzy sets library. 

Later:

* market model
* production 
* dynamic models

* Thank you.
