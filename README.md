# fuzyecon
Mathematical economics is some system of formulas and models for economic science.
I want to use R laguage library for fuzzy sets, and write about

> *fuzzy inference*

in this context.

The ("sets") library in R is a tool where fuzzy logic is implemented.

> e.g. fuzzy inference, fuzzy system, fuzzy rules and other tools.

Here is the description on how to use some features of the fuzzy set "sets" lib:

https://juandes.github.io/FuzzyLogic-R/docs/fuzzy_tutorial

here, under: fuzzy_inferecne are some details (among other information):

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sets/sets.pdf

This project covers many topics:

* preference relation
* income field
  
... soon:

* utility function
* demand function
* derivatives in utility function

<br/>

* Other topics are not included (market model, production, dynamic models).
* Thank you.
