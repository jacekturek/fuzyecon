# fuzyecon
Mathematical economics can be written in R (simulations).

I want to use:
* R language (sets library)
* to use AI = fuzzy sets to describe the formulas 
* rather than with simulations.

The AI library is a full fuzzy sets useful toolkit - it can be used in many contexts.
The key to use fuzzy set library is research tool + theory (fuzzy sets have different possibilites).

Covers many topics:

* preference relation
* income field
* ...
