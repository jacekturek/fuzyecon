# fuzyecon
Mathematical economics is some system of formulas and models for economic science.
I want to use R laguage library for fuzzy sets, and write about

> *AI and fuzzy logic*

The ("sets") library in R is a tool where fuzzy logic is implemented.

> examples are: fuzzy inference, fuzzy system, fuzzy rules and other.

It is iteresting to learn about the features of fuzzy sets as well as fuzzy logic to use AI in modeling.

##

Here is the description on how to use some features of the fuzzy set "sets" lib:

https://juandes.github.io/FuzzyLogic-R/docs/fuzzy_tutorial

here, under: fuzzy_inferecne are some details about how to use it:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sets/sets.pdf

These topics are modeled in R:

* demand theory
  * preference relations, 
  * budget field,
  * utility function,
  * demand function,
  * derivatives in utility function 

using fuzzy sets library. 

Later:

* market model
* production 
* dynamic models

* Thank you.
