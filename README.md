# fuzyecon
Mathematical economics is some system of formulas and models for economic science.
I want to use R laguage library for fuzzy sets, and write about

> *AI and fuzzy logic*

in this context.

The ("sets") library in R is a tool where fuzzy logic is implemented.

> e.g. fuzzy inference, fuzzy system, fuzzy rules and other.

It is iteresting to learn about the features of fuzzy sets as well as fuzzy logic to use AI in econometric modeling.

##

Here is the description on how to use some features of the fuzzy set "sets" lib:

https://juandes.github.io/FuzzyLogic-R/docs/fuzzy_tutorial

here, under: fuzzy_inferecne are some details about how to use it:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sets/sets.pdf

This project covers demo for:

* demand theory

and uses fuzzy sets. 

> Fuzzy sets features for modeling.

Other topics are not included:

* market model
* production 
* dynamic models

* Thank you.
