# The waterfall deveoplment model

* sequential approach
* rigorous planning

# The model:

* mathematical economics is theory in which some notions of economics are explain in mathematical formulas
* they can be as well modeled in AI - with FUZZY LOGIC
* apart from 'normal' simulations
* design: I think each such case can be 'partially' (mathematically) proved
* impelementation is R examples
* the system is the whole description in this documentation with some rsults
* this is to show the results
