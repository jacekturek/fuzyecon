# The waterfall deveoplment model

* sequential approach
  Covers some topics from the sources on Mathematical Economics
* rigorous planning
  Fuzzy sets used as a research tool for the topics mentioned in the readme

# The model:

* mathematical economics is theory in which some notions of economics are explain in mathematical formulas
* they can be as well modeled in AI - with FUZZY LOGIC
* apart from 'normal' simulations
* design: I think each such case can be 'partially' (mathematically) proved
* impelementation is R examples
* the system is the whole description in this documentation with some rsults
* this is to show the results
